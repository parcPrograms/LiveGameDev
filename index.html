  <h1>Let's Make A Game Live</h1>

<p>We hope you enjoyed the live game dev!
<br>When able we strive to make the games available for everyone to play.
<br>We understand that internet and data at a convention can be sparse,
so this page is kept bare bones for savings on your time, wallet, and my sanity.
